# UTF-8 to Bytes

A webpage that displays a UTF-8 strings as individual bytes.

Inspired by [Bytes: The Lesser-Known Python Built-In Sequence • And Understanding UTF-8 Encoding](https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/bytes-python-built-in-unicode-utf-8-encoding) by Stephen Gruppetta.

## Development

Run a PHP static web server and then access [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```
php -S localhost:8000  
```

## Notes

I used this project as chance to use modern web development practices:

- CSS Layers
- CSS Nesting
- JS Importmaps
- Web Components
