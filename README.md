Inspired by [Bytes: The Lesser-Known Python Built-In Sequence • And Understanding UTF-8 Encoding](https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/bytes-python-built-in-unicode-utf-8-encoding) by Stephen Gruppetta.

## Development

Run a PHP static web server and then access [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```
php -S localhost:8000  
```

## Notes

I used modern web development practices to build this project:

- CSS Layers, Nesting, Grid, Flexbox, Has and Variables
- JS Importmaps
- Web Components

## Todos

- [ ] See if characters can be linked/broken down from query string.
- [ ] Add link/icon to code on GitHub.
